                  <p>
                    A new feature has come to EVE Portal, the official EVE Online companion app. Exclusively for players
                    in Omega Clone state, the Jita PLEX Market will enable you to trade PLEX anytime and anywhere,
                    directly from your mobile device via the EVE Portal app.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Jita PLEX Market gives you the ability to trade PLEX for ISK and vice versa. All transactions go
                    through the Jita 4-4 market where players can browse and create PLEX sell & buy orders. In addition,
                    you can browse and modify/cancel outstanding PLEX orders and browse your PLEX transaction history.
                  </p>

                  <p>Capsuleer Day Celebration</p>
                  <p>
                    The 17th birthday of EVE Online will be marked by daily Capsuleer Day Celebration login rewards!
                    Running from 5 May to 19 May, rewards will include SKINs, apparel, Skill Points, Filaments and
                    Boosters, with Omega Clone State Capsuleers receiving all the Alpha rewards, plus bigger and better
                    Omega gifts too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You must log in on 10 out of 14 days during the event to receive all items, and Capsuleers who
                    upgrade to Omega during the event can retroactively claim all the Omega rewards they missed before
                    the end.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In addition, to commemorate the anniversary of the birth of Capsuleers in New Eden and earn goodwill
                    with the independent pilots of the cluster, CONCORD, the Empires and Upwell are preparing a series
                    of gifts for Capsuleers. However, a large-scale attack from the Triglavian Collective against their
                    joint production and research facilities threatens to disrupt the celebration! CONCORD is requesting
                    that Capsuleers seek out these besieged facilities in order to drive away the Triglavian forces and
                    claim extra gifts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There will be Capsuleer Day Clash event sites available from 7 May to 20 May throughout New Eden,
                    restricted to allow Battlecruisers only, with more advanced sites all over Lowsec, Nullsec and
                    wormhole space. Rewards will include new SKINs, limited time cerebral accelerators, limited time
                    standings boosters and special limited time 10 pilot Needlejack Filaments!

                    Log in between 11:00 UTC on 28 April and 11:00 UTC on 4 May and accept increasingly deadly daily
                    challenges where you will have to kill either Abyssal Drones, Drifters, Sleepers or Triglavians in
                    Abyssal Deadspace for Skill Point rewards.

                  <p>Hello spacefriends!</p>
                  <p>
                    Today is a special day - the 24th of April 2020 is 7 years to the day of the amazing EVE symphony
                    event that was held at Fanfest 2013 for EVE Online's 10th anniversary.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now that our Sunday night streams have been occurring
                    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ccp/videos" class="CCPlink" target="_blank">with some regularity</a>,
                    viewers have been suggesting ideas for things they'd love to to see on the stream. At the top of the
                    list is a focus on the classic EVE music that we've known and loved for almost 20 years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given this timing for the symphony and the feedback from players, we figured it would be the perfect
                    moment to revisit that amazing event and bring in some very special guests.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Joining us this Sunday, 26 April from 19:30 EVE time on
                    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ccp/" class="CCPlink" target="_blank">CCP's Twitch channel</a> will
                    be:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>JÃ³n Hallur Haraldsson - composer of the original EVE Online soundtrack</li>
                    <li>Baldur Baldursson (CCP Oldboy) - EVE Online Audio Director</li>
                    <li>KristjÃ¡n GuÃ°jÃ³nsson - composer and arranger for the EVE symphony event</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    We'll be streaming the EVE symphony from Fanfest 2013. Before, between and afterwards we'll be
                    talking to those involved to learn more about what went in to making the event a success and also
                    the history of the classic music of EVE Online.
                  </p>
                  <p>We hope we'll see you there!</p>

                  <p>
                    Once again we have another very special guest for you - one of the most storied and (in)famous
                    figures to ever emerge from New Eden - Lord Maldoror from Rooks and Kings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Rooks and Kings became legendary for their innovative theorycrafting, brilliant mechanical execution
                    and the
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Rooksandkings/videos" class="CCPlink" target="_blank"
                      >amazing videos</a
                    >
                    produced and narrated by Lord Maldoror which lionised their exploits. Many of the combat techniques
                    pioneered by Rooks and Kings found their way into the permanent meta of EVE Online, and the terms
                    they coined are now a part of every EVE player's vocabulary. Their influence on the game cannot be
                    overstated.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Perhaps best known for the Clarion Call series, Rooks and Kings has also released many other classic
                    videos such as Anatomy of a Fight, Iron Clad and The False Tower. They also featured prominently in
                    the famous
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdfFnTt2UT0" class="CCPlink" target="_blank"
                      >This is EVE trailer</a
                    >
                    which showcased their notorious pipebomb traps.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Although there is enough existing Rooks and Kings material to run several streams - and we will be
                    showing some of their most popular videos - I'm excited to let you know that Lord Maldoror has been
                    digging through his archives and has uncovered a significant amount of never-before-seen Rooks and
                    Kings material. I've had a preview of some of it and I think you will like what you see!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the stream Lord Maldoror will also be sharing his anecdotes and knowledge as he pulls back
                    the veil on Rooks and Kings.
                  </p>

                  <p>Dear Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    In light of the continuing global developments and restrictions surrounding the spread of the
                    COVID-19 coronavirus, we have taken the decision to cancel the EVE Russia 2020 event in Moscow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We know how deeply disappointing this news will be for our wonderful Russian-speaking community, but
                    we feel it is absolutely crucial to continue following the most responsible course of action and
                    prioritize the safety and well-being of our attendees, our staff and of course the general public.
                    Therefore, this necessary decision was taken after an in-depth and serious review.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We wanted to get this information to you as swiftly as possible in order to allow you to make the
                    necessary changes to any travel or accommodation arrangements that you may have made. We will begin
                    the process of ticket reimbursement shortly.
                  </p>
                  <p>Fly safe, Capsuleers.</p>

                    Bold changes are being made across EVE in the quest for diversity and new exciting options for
                    Capsuleers. Surgical Strike will accomplish a number of things, including bringing Capital
                    survivability more in line with the rest of New Eden, reducing the overwhelming power of logistics,
                    introducing adjustments to some long-standing powerhouses in the Subcapital meta and more.

                  <p>
                    The brand new and absolutely striking Helmatt's Harriers SKIN is now available in EVE Online's New
                    Eden Store for three Guristas hulls, those being the Gila, Rattlesnake and Worm!

                  <p>
                    This SKIN pays tribute to the notorious and brash Guristas combat pilot Lucash Helmatt, whose
                    personal wing of raiders, the Harriers, are feared far-and-wide. Lucash had all Helmatt's Harriers
                    ships painted in bright and disruptive yellow and black with an eye to intimidation and maintaining
                    his personal notoriety, an inspiration that is clearly visible in this series of SKINs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The New Eden Store will also be running a 33% sale on selected SKINs between 9 April and 23 April,
                    with different SKINs enjoying that discount on the two separate weeks. Finally, the Hostile Takeover
                    SKIN line will be retired after 16 April, so act fast if you want to add it to your collection!

                  <p>
                    The Hunt event has returned and is now live! At a time of year when Capsuleers undertake their
                    now-annual pod hunt, you are tasked with the challenge of using directional and probe scanners to
                    hunt down and destroy NPC capsules in order to gain access to special event sites and valuable
                    rewards until 11:00 UTC on 21 April.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This event has smaller ship classes like Frigates and Destroyers as the focus, so pilots with less
                    experience and fewer skills trained can get involved. During The Hunt, player pods will have a
                    chance of dropping their implants as loot when destroyed!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Hunt will also introduce the brand new Guristas Hydra Implant Set, which may drop as a reward
                    from one of the special event sites. These powerful new implants will improve both drone and missile
                    systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>Let the podding begin!</p>

                  <p>Hello spacefriends!</p>
                  <p>
                    Last weekend we hosted
                    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/578532613" class="CCPlink" target="_blank">an epic stream</a>
                    on the CCP Twitch channel where the EVE community gathered together for a Clear Skies marathon with
                    series creator Ian Chisholm. It was a big hit with the players and the feels were real, so let's go
                    again!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As a follow up to that event, and off the back of
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hon1L7_HNMI" class="CCPlink" target="_blank"
                      >our epic Eclipse Quadrant 2 trailer</a
                    >, we'll go for another walk down memory lane, this time with CCP's Cinematic Lead - CCP Zond 3.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    EVE Online trailers are near and dear to many of our hearts and often define the various epochs of
                    EVE Online that we've experienced, and we all have our favourites from years past. CCP Zond 3 has
                    been with CCP for a long time and his fingerprints are all over the trailers you know and love and
                    he will be sharing his insights about their creation with us all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even before joining CCP, Zond 3 was actively creating EVE cinematics - the most famous of which is
                    probably player favourite
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5LdPf2J_hs" class="CCPlink" target="_blank"

                    - and we'll be discussing those too!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In between enjoying some classic EVE trailers together, we'll be talking with CCP Zond 3 about the
                    creative process that goes into them, the tools he uses and the challenges our cinematics team faces
                    when trying to deliver the most amazing visuals in our industry to the players of EVE Online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Along the way, for the first time ever, we'll be showing never before seen work-in-progress versions
                    of some of the most famous EVE trailers which will probably surprise and delight those who are
                    watching live!
                  </p>

                  <p>Shifting the balance of power in New Eden, Kicking off on 6 April ...</p>

                  <p>
                    EVE Online's Quadrant 2 is called "Eclipse" and its arrival is imminent! Kicking off on 6 April, the
                    overall theme will revolve around shifting the balance of power in New Eden. The Fight or Flight
                    Quadrant was fantastic, featuring a wide variety of highlights such as the Frigate Escape Bay,
                    Loyalty to Lowsec, From Wormholes With Love, The Dragonaur Blitz and much much more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Eclipse Quadrant will follow that up in force with events, celebrations, login campaigns, visual
                    updates, huge balance changes, new and mysterious ships and weapons, as well as the final chapter of
                    the Invasion expansion.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    First up will be the return of The Hunt event on 6 April, a time of year when Capsuleers will
                    undertake their now-annual egg hunt! Players will be tasked with the challenge of hunting down and
                    scanning capsules in order to gain access to special event sites, and potentially valuable drops.
                    This will be an event with smaller ship classes like Frigates and Destroyers as the focus, so pilots
                    with less experience and fewer skills trained can get involved. During The Hunt, player pods will
                    have a chance of dropping their implants as loot when destroyed!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With EVE Online celebrating its 17th anniversary in May, Eclipse is only the start of seismic
                    changes hurtling towards the denizens of New Eden. Chapter 3 of the Triglavian Invasion story line
                    is set to unfold with players influencing the outcome of this star-spanning conflict. The landscape
                    of New Eden will never be the same again, forcing Capsuleers to adapt to new and unprecedented
                    challenges.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Keep your eyes peeled for even more news on what's coming during the Eclipse Quadrant over the
                    following weeks, and fly safe!

                  <p>We're excited to announce a new addition to our range of localized clients ...</p>

                  <p>Greetings capsuleers!</p>
                  <p>
                    Off the back of our successful Korean localization which launched last November, CCP has actively
                    been exploring additional territories to localize. We plan to focus on areas with significant player
                    density and a local language which is often difficult for the broader EVE community to comprehend.
                  </p>
                  <p>So we're pleased to announced today that EVE Online will soon be localised in Australian!</p>
                  <p>
                    Despite enjoying many benefits when playing EVE Online due to their geographic location such as:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>a conveniently placed downtime to enable a relaxing break in the middle of primetime</li>
                    <li>an abundance of Citadel vulnerability windows timed to their region to take advantage of</li>
                    <li>
                      the inability to align and warp anything in under two seconds which makes running gate-camps
                      especially enjoyable and exciting
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    Australian players often struggle with many basic interactions in the EVE client, as many EU and US
                    fleet commanders can attest to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    CEO of CCP Games, Hilmar Veigar PÃ©tursson said: "I made my first trip to Australia last year for EVE
                    Down Under as part of our Invasion World Tour. Having had many conversations with our wonderful
                    Australian timezone players while I was there, I have become acutely aware of the challenges they
                    face every day communicating with the rest of the EVE Online community. I think it's fantastic that
                    we are making New Eden more accessible to people from around the world."
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Along with this localization, we are also anticipating a potential explosion of new players from
                    Australia now that fast and reliable high-speed internet of up to 1Mbps is available to nearly 2% of
                    households.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is not currently a set date for launch of the localization but to ensure it's released as
                    quickly as possible, CCP is suspending all other development work on EVE Online (except the
                    production of new SKINs) until it's completed.
                  </p>
                  <p>You can see an early WIP screenshot of the localized client here:</p>

                  </div>

                  <p>
                    Thank you for your attention! The first of many Australian translations for our upcoming news items
                    follows:
                  </p>
                  <p>G'day mates!</p>
                  <p>
                    So the Korean thingy absolutely caned and we were like "Oi, how good would it be if we did it for
                    Aussies too?"
                  </p>
                  <p>And Hilmo was like "Nah, yeah, that'd be sick mate. Get crackin'."</p>
                  <p>So how good's this? Soon we can talk in 'strayan while we're flyin spaceships.</p>
                  <p>
                    If you've been hanging for internet spaceships like a Bunning's snag on satdee mornin then this'll
                    go alright I reckon. So chuck on some Barnesy (or Farnesy!), kick your PC in the guts and cut sick
                    in New Eden!
                  </p>

                    Clear Skies is one of the most ambitious and successful creative endeavors to ever come out of the
                    EVE Online community. When the first Clear Skies movie landed in 2008 it was the culmination of
                    years of work by its creator Ian Chisholm and was met with wild acclaim. As well as being
                    immediately embraced by passionate EVE players, it would also go on to win several machinima awards
                    and expose EVE Online to a larger audience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Spurred on by its reception, Ian would create two further instalments and each one would be more
                    sophisticated and polished than the last. The trilogy concluded with Clear Skies 3 in 2011. We
                    published a

                  <p>
                    With the current situation where many of us are holed up in our homes, isolated from our friends,
                    workmates and regular lives, we thought it would be nice to fire up the friendship machine, watch
                    Clear Skies together and celebrate the two best ships in EVE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On Sunday, 29 March from 19:30 EVE time, CCP TV will be hosting a marathon of all three Clear Skies
                    movies back-to-back on
                    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ccp" class="CCPlink" target="_blank">our Twitch channel</a>, and
                    we're excited to let you know that Clear Skies creator Ian Chisholm will be joining us live on the
                    stream to provide a running director commentary throughout the marathon. No doubt he'll be able to
                    share a lot of interesting insights into the production and technical hurdles he faced while making
                    Clear Skies. Even if you've watched Clear Skies before, this should be a new experience!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    After the movies conclude, Ian will stick around for some Q and A with the viewers where you can
                    pitch any questions you have about the series or maybe ask if there's something new in store for
                    John Rourke and his crew...?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So come along, hang out and chat with your fellow internet spaceship enthusiasts and enjoy some
                    awesome EVE Online machinima.
                  </p>
                  <p>Just because we're all stuck indoors doesn't mean we can't enjoy Clear Skies!</p>

                  <p>Loyal Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    Those of you who have made your homes and livelihoods in the Low Security (Lowsec) star systems of
                    New Eden are to be commended - and rewarded - for your loyalty to this way of life. The Loyalty to
                    Lowsec update coming on 24 March will provide a thrilling climax to the Fight or Flight Quadrant,
                    featuring a number of changes to Faction Warfare as well as other aspects of Lowsec adventuring that
                    will bring fresh excitement and activity to these regions of New Eden.
                  </p>
                  <p>Faction Warfare</p>
                  <p>
                    As mentioned throughout last year, there will be changes to Faction Warfare in EVE Online to improve
                    the overall experience of Capsuleers engaging with this feature. This begins with increased Loyalty
                    Point payouts for PvP kills made during Faction Warfare. At the same time, Loyalty Point payouts for
                    Faction Warfare missions given by agents will be reduced, which will increase the relative value of
                    combat in Faction Warfare.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, there will be an increase in the activation area that surrounds acceleration gates.
                    This will allow Capsuleers to enter Faction Warfare combat complexes with less chance of being
                    tackled or stopped before entering the main complex area. This will effectively re-introduce the
                    player-emergent behavior of 'gate sliding', and will be supported by the introduction of perimeter
                    lighting around the acceleration gates to indicate the extent of the activation region surrounding
                    it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As if that wasn't enough love for Faction Warfare, this feature will also see new gated capture
                    sites that allow entry for all ships of Battleship size and smaller added. This presents a perfect
                    opportunity for Capsuleers to make use of the brand new and exciting Frigate Escape Bay feature!

                    24 March. The Frigate Escape Bay is a special bay capable of holding a single, fitted Frigate that
                    will be added to all Battleships. Should the Battleship be destroyed, instead of being ejected in
                    your capsule and left helpless, you will launch immediately back into combat aboard your Frigate!

                    Seeing how Capsuleers utilize Frigate Escape Bay tactics in the new Battleship-specific Faction

                  <p>Increased PvP Loot Drops and Warp Speed Increase</p>
                  <p>
                    Why stop there with the Lowsec love? As part of the Loyalty to Lowsec update, there will be an
                    increase to the loot dropped from PvP in Lowsec space and an increase to warp speed in Lowsec
                    between 24 March and 6 April. These limited time changes will promote further PvP activity in
                    Lowsec, undoubtedly having an effect on how Capsuleers make use of them during Faction Warfare, in
                    no small part due to the significant speed boost Battleships will enjoy!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There will also be an additional task added to the daily PvP challenges of the Skilling is Just a
                    Means event that runs until 14 April. Capsuleers will be offered an extra 10,000 Skill Points daily
                    for killing one of the NPCs defending the Faction Warfare capture sites, so that makes 20,000 Skill
                    Points available every day!
                  </p>
                  <p>Champions of Lowsec</p>
                  <p>
                    Inspired by the legendary Kings of Lowsec contest that took place in 2013 which was a 24 hour Lowsec
                    killing spree, the contest to crown a champion of Lowsec will be returning to New Eden between 26
                    and 31 March! The alliance that accrues the highest ISK value of Lowsec PvP kills in that time will
                    receive awesome rewards, and their alliance's flag will be flown proudly on top of the Groska
                    building, the new home of CCP's ReykjavÃ­k office, for a month!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More details on this event are coming soon, and the Faction Warfare changes, warp speed and PvP loot
                    drop increases are now live on the Singularity test server for you to try out!

                  <p>Hello charitable capsuleers!</p>
                  <p>
                    With our monthly release tomorrow, we will be delivering the PLEX for GOOD reward apparel to our
                    awesome donors:

                  <p>
                    The DED's Reserve Frontier Safeguard service, commonly known as the RFS or "Safeguarders", has its
                    origins in a lowsec/nullsec frontier patrol operated using reservists from the member states of
                    CONCORD. The RFS originally provided a security patrol presence in lowsec systems with planetary
                    colonies and other orbital settlements. Since the expansion of CONCORD's mandate and permanent DED
                    fleet capacity in YC105, the RFS has evolved into an organization focused on providing disaster
                    relief to colonies across lowsec space.

                  <p>
                    As mentioned in

                    will receive two pairs and then an additional pair for every 500 PLEX donated after that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Now, this is where we hit a bit of a wrinkle. Due to the fact that we weren't able to announce the
                    in-game rewards until midway through the campaign, some players contributed PLEX to corp or alliance
                    collections or donated to streamers etc. as part of 3rd party fundraising drives. This means we
                    won't have a record of the contributions for those who didn't directly send their donations to the
                    CCP PLEX for GOOD character.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If that's you, in the first instance we request that you reach out to the person who you sent your
                    PLEX to and ask that they contract you the number of shirts you're entitled to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you don't get a response you can then send an in-game evemail to the character

                    stating the amount of PLEX you donated and we will contract your shirts in Jita 4-4.
                  </p>
                  <p>This offer will only be available until downtime on Friday, 20 March 2020.</p>
                  <p>
                    In the event someone claims to have donated a large volume of PLEX we will have to verify that
                    first. You can help by linking the original PLEX contract in the evemail. If you are unable to
                    locate the contract or it was too long ago we have other means of confirming the donation, it'll
                    just take a little more work on our end.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We realise this is a little bit messy but we didn't want to hold up launching the campaign while we
                    were figuring out if we had the bandwidth to get rewards made. We want to properly thank everyone
                    for their generosity and make sure everyone receives the rewards they're entitled to.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the PLEX for GOOD campaign we relied on the generosity of the community and you didn't let us
                    down, so now we're relying on your honesty when it comes to claiming your apparel. Thank you for
                    your understanding!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In conclusion I would once again like to point to CCP's especially firm position when it comes to
                    scamming related to PLEX for GOOD:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    IMPORTANT: CCP regards any scamming attempts surrounding PLEX for GOOD to be morally reprehensible,
                    and any attempts at scamming relating to this program will be met with the harshest and swiftest
                    action at our disposal. If you become aware of anyone attempting a scam related to PLEX for GOOD
                    please notify us at support@eveonline.com

                  <p>
                    The Skilling Spree and Chilling Spree events have been very popular with Capsuleers, and now the
                    event returns with a PvP twist!

                  <p>
                    Capsuleers will be awarded Skill Points during the Skilling is Just a Means of Communication event
                    for PvP kills, with daily challenges being issued at downtime each day between 12 March and 14
                    April.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    You can rack up hundreds of thousands of Skill Points throughout the event by destroying player
                    ships, and then use your amassed Skill Points to speed up training in any area you choose to
                    specialize in.
                  </p>
                  <p>Good luck out there, Capsuleers, and watch your backs!</p>

                  <p>Due to safety concerns surrounding spread of coronavirus...</p>

                  <p>Dear Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    In light of the recent and ongoing global developments surrounding the spread of the COVID-19
                    coronavirus, we have taken the decision to cancel this yearâ€™s Fanfest event in Reykjavik, Iceland.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is with a heavy heart that we make this decision, and we know this news will be disappointing to
                    our wonderful community, but we feel absolutely compelled to follow the most responsible course of
                    action and prioritize the safety and well-being of our attendees, our staff and of course the
                    general Icelandic public.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We realize that the situation a month from now could be very different, but the way events are
                    developing both globally and in Icelandâ€™s neighboring countries, an in-depth and serious review has
                    made it clear that this is a necessary step to take.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We wanted to get this information to you as swiftly as possible in order to allow you to make the
                    necessary changes to any travel or accommodation arrangements that you may have made. We will be
                    providing further details over the course of the next few weeks, so please keep an eye on all EVE
                    Online social media channels for these updates.
                  </p>
                  <p>Fly safe.</p>

                    Tickets for EVE Russia - Moscow 2020 on 13 -14 June are now live, so what better way to celebrate
                    EVE's Russian player community than to get together right after Russia Day?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If last year's EVE Russia event in St. Petersburg is anything to go by, they're gonna sell out fast,
                    so make sure you don't miss out! The event will take place at
                    <a href="http://centrehall.ru/" class="CCPlink" target="_blank">the Centre Hall</a> in Moscow.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Tickets for EVE Russia - Moscow 2020 are 2000 rubles, which covers both days of the event, and that
                    also includes an EVE Russia T-shirt and more goodies for attendees. Food and drink will be available
                    for purchase at the venue
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This will be the biggest and most ambitious EVE Russia event yet, featuring presentations, CCP CEO
                    Hilmar Veigar PÃ©tursson and many EVE Online developers in attendance, roundtables, an Art Corner,
                    the 'Friendship" river cruise, party and more!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Saturday 13 June will be the main day for presentations, followed by an amazing party, then Sunday
                    14 June will be focused on letting the players interact with Devs during specific activities such as
                    an Art Corner, roundtables and then a river cruise in the evening. Tickets for the river cruise will
                    be made available at a later date.

                  <p>Dear Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    Back in January,
                    <a
                      href="https://www.eveonline.com/article/q4m3zu/64-bit-client-transition-complete"

                      >we reported</a
                    >
                    that the transition to a 64-bit client was complete and we would be deprecating the 32-bit client on
                    Wednesday, 26th February.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As of today, users will be unable to launch the 32-bit version of EVE and must use the 64-bit
                    version of the game. If you have previously manually selected the 32-bit client in the launcher, you
                    will be automatically moved back to the 64bit version of the client, provided your system supports
                    64-bit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The move to a single 64-bit client will reduce the development time associated with maintaining two
                    clients, while allowing further investment into the technical infrastructure of EVE Online.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the 64-bit client has been in use by the vast majority of our players, if you experience any

                  <p>Intrepid Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    During the Naughty or Nice winter holiday event, New Eden was introduced to the exciting
                    reindeer-themed jump Filaments that were capable of catapulting fleets from anywhere in space to
                    random Nullsec systems. This had the delightful effect of pitting Capsuleer fleets against each
                    other in unexpected (for some) combat! The good news is, these Filaments are now returning to New
                    Eden permanently and will be available as early as Thursday, 27 February!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There will be six variations of the new Needlejack Filaments, capable of moving up to 5, 15 or 25
                    players into a random Nullsec system upon activation. Some of the Needlejack Filaments will be
                    available in a fully built state and will drop in exploration data sites, while others can be
                    manufactured from BPCs. Some will even be distributed exclusively through upcoming events.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once you get your hands on these jump Filaments, you can once again yeet your fleet directly into
                    some action. Happy hunting, Capsuleers!
                  </p>

                  <p>Test the new upcoming feature on Singularity ...</p>

                  <p>Tenacious Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    Itâ€™s time to let you in on a new feature that will be arriving in late March as part of the Fight or
                    Flight Quadrant, the Frigate Escape Bay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Frigate Escape Bay is a special bay capable of holding a single, fitted Frigate that will be
                    added to all Battleships. Should the Battleship be destroyed, instead of being ejected in your
                    capsule and left helpless, you will launch immediately back into combat aboard your Frigate!
                  </p>
                  <p>The Frigate hulls that will be allowed to be stored in the bay are:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>All T1 Frigates</li>
                    <li>Assault Frigates</li>
                    <li>Electronic Attack Frigates</li>
                    <li>Logistics Frigates</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    This change will shake up the Battleship meta of EVE Online and open up new and exciting tactical
                    options for crafty players to use! It can also give Capsuleers a chance to stay in the fight
                    longer... unless you opt to use your nimble ship to escape from the battlefield and leave your
                    fleetmates to their fate!
                  </p>
                  <p>Fight or Flight - the choice is yours.</p>
                  <p>
                    What is even more exciting is the fact that the Frigate Escape Bay will be available for testing on
                    Singularity next Monday! Go ahead, try them out and

                  <p>
                    It's that time of year where showing affection and appreciation is important, so what better time to
                    show your additional EVE Online accounts some love and

                    until 11:00 UTC on 19 February! Use the opportunity to start playing EVE the right way!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you are not currently an Omega, you can upgrade and get 1 month of Omega at 15% off, and still be
                    eligible to upgrade your additional accounts to Omega using the 25% discount.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Playing EVE Online with multiple accounts means that you can have more than one character logged
                    into the game simultaneously, and more accounts mean more skill training. This allows you to highly
                    specialize characters on different accounts for particular roles, especially if all accounts are
                    Omega. You can then fly both characters together in-game during a fight and salvage operation, one
                    can haul goods while the other runs missions, or you could have one scout dangerous star systems for
                    the other!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Upgrading to Omega takes your EVE experience to the next level, unlocking all 350+ ships, all
                    skills, an infinite skill queue and double training speed, plus unlimited access to Planetary
                    Interaction and the contracts system.

                  <p>
                    If you are currently Alpha or do not currently have an additional account and would like to make use
                    of the offer, you can

                  <p>Next Tuesday Wormholes are receiving a loving update...</p>

                  <p>Adventurous Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    It's been an amazing 11 years since wormholes were first introduced as a feature to EVE Online as
                    part of the Apocrypha expansion in March 2009, allowing Capsuleers to explore uncharted regions of
                    space through those unstable gateways to the unknown. To celebrate this anniversary, and this
                    amorous time of year, wormholes are receiving a loving update!
                  </p>

                  <br />

                  <p>FROM WORMHOLES WITH LOVE</p>
                  <p>
                    The main thrust of this update that will arrive next Tuesday is added connectivity. The chance of
                    connections appearing between wormholes is going to increase greatly. Look out especially for added
                    roaming connections between high class wormholes!
                  </p>
                  <p>Weâ€™ve also made changes to a certain Drifter NPC who loved the Astrahus a little too much.</p>
                  <p>
                    To further celebrate wormholes, EVE Online's New Eden Store will be running discounts on SKINs
                    belonging to ships that are often used by Capsuleers in wormhole space. Starting at 25% off, there
                    are offers on the Sisters of EVE One Eden Bundle, the Heron Zento Isidenko Combine SKIN and more.
                    The sale starts at 11:00 UTC on 11 Feb and finishes at 11:00 UTC on 18 Feb.
                  </p>

                  <br />

                  <p>GUARDIAN'S GALA</p>
                  <p>
                    This year, the Guardian's Gala - the annual get together for the Angel Cartel and Serpentis pirates
                    to celebrate their spoils - is not only taking place in k-space, but there will also be more
                    challenging sites with more unique rewards in wormhole space! Running from 13 to 24 February, the
                    rewards for Capsuleers who successfully gatecrash the outlaws' celebrations will include the new
                    Savior Angel Cartel Logistics Implant Set.
                  </p>

                  <br />

                  <p>INCREASED LOOT DROPS</p>
                  <p>
                    In addition to the above, there will be a limited time increase in loot drops from PvP in wormhole
                    space to coincide with the Guardian's Gala event. This will be happening between 13 and 24 February,
                    so make sure you're ready for it!
                  </p>

                    Scott Manley will be joining us at Fanfest 2020 and will be speaking to those in attendance. Scott
                    recently made the EVE, gaming and world-in-general news when he won a Gold Magnate in an auction,
                    paying and astounding 1,000,000 PLEX for the privelege of owning this exceedingly rare internet
                    spaceship. Most special of all though, the PLEX was in turn donated to PLEX for GOOD by the Gold
                    Magnate's former owner Kelon Darklight in an incredible display of space-philanthropy.

                    CCP is happy to confirm that we will once again have in-game rewards for people who donated to PLEX
                    for GOOD. Just as with previous campaigns, those who donated will be receiving some special,
                    limited-edition apparel for your avatars to wear proudly. Everyone who has donated to PLEX for GOOD
                    will receive a pair (one womenâ€™s and one menâ€™s) Reserve Frontier Safeguard (RFS) shirt:

                  <p>
                    The DED's Reserve Frontier Safeguard service, commonly known as the RFS or "Safeguarders", has its
                    origins in a lowsec/nullsec frontier patrol operated using reservists from the member states of
                    CONCORD. The RFS originally provided a security patrol presence in lowsec systems with planetary
                    colonies and other orbital settlements. Since the expansion of CONCORD's mandate and permanent DED
                    fleet capacity in YC105, the RFS has evolved into an organization focused on providing disaster
                    relief to colonies across lowsec space.

                    Our brilliant art team is hard at work on them and we will deliver them to donors in the months
                    after the campaign concludes. We think youâ€™ll really like them and thank you in advance for your
                    patience!

                  <p>
                    Anyone who donated the minimum 100 PLEX will receive one pair of the shirts. At 500 PLEX you will
                    receive two pairs and then an additional pair for every 500 PLEX donated after that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the event that you have already donated but didnâ€™t make your donations personally (i.e. you
                    contributed to a collection on behalf of your corp, alliance or player group) there will be an
                    opportunity to work things out when the shirts are completed so that everyone receives their
                    rewards.

                  <p>Skilled Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    Bonus Skill Point Weekend is returning between 24 and 27 January 2020, with massive Skill Point
                    rewards for both Alpha and Omega Clone State pilots! Log in daily to claim thousands of Skill Points
                    that you can use to boost your training, honing combat skills that are great for the Fight or Flight
                    Quadrant events.

                  </div>

                  <p>
                    If that isnâ€™t enough to quench your thirst for Skill Points, then youâ€™â€™ll be thrilled to hear that
                    due to popular demand, the Skilling Spree will also be returning to New Eden! From 28 January to 2
                    March, pilots will receive one of three randomly selected challenges that offer either 10k, 25k, or
                    a whopping 50k Skill Points as a reward for destroying NPC vessels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Pilots will be rewarded upon completing the challenge, and a new one will be offered to them at the
                    next daily downtime. If the challenge is not completed successfully, it will be replaced by another
                    randomly selected challenge during the next daily downtime at 11:00 UTC.
                  </p>

                  <br /><br />

                  <p>USEFUL INFORMATION</p>
                  <p>Here are some clarifications for the Bonus Skill Point event:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Pilots can claim one reward (consisting of both one Alpha and one Omega reward depending on clone
                      status) per day.
                    </li>
                    <li>New Eden counts days from downtime to downtime. Rewards refresh at 11:00 UTC each day.</li>
                    <li>
                      The day one reward is the first that a player can claim, regardless of which day of the event they
                      claim it on. They then claim the day two reward the next day, and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>One set of rewards is available for every account in game.</li>
                    <li>
                      One set of rewards is only available for Omega accounts - claiming this reward gives both the
                      Alpha and Omega reward for that day.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Should an Alpha account upgrade to Omega at any point during the event, they will receive all
                      Omega rewards retroactively for the days that they have claimed in the event so far.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <br /><br />

                  <p>HOW DO I CLAIM MY SKILL POINTS?</p>
                  <p>
                    To claim your Skill Points, all you need to do is log in to EVE Online and follow these simple
                    instructions on the character selection screen:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Click "Claim All" at the bottom of the highlighted day in the Daily Login Campaigns window.</li>
                    <li>You will then receive a confirmation that you've claimed the day's Skill Points.</li>
                    <li>You'll now see a "Redeemable Items" bar at the bottom of the screen, click it to expand it.</li>
                    <li>
                      Your Skill Points are right there, simply drag and drop them onto the character you'd like to use
                      them on. As you drag and drop the Skill Points, you'll receive a confirmation that tells you they
                      have been delivered to your character's unallocated Skill Point queue.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    PLEX for GOOD for the Australian Bushfires concludes at 11:59pm EVE time on Sunday, 26 January. For
                    the grand finale
                    <a href="https://streamfleet.org/" class="CCPlink" target="_blank">Streamfleet</a> is organising a
                    48-hour raid-a-thon and weâ€™re calling upon all EVE streamers to take part!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A raid-a-thon is kind of like a relay race on Twitch. EVE streamers will be given a slot during the
                    48 hour period where they will stream for two hours and then their viewers will raid the channel of
                    the next streamer on the schedule. Itâ€™s a non-stop EVE extravaganza running around the clock for two
                    days straight!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Itâ€™s a great way for viewers to discover new EVE content creators and for streamers to find a new
                    audience. Plus, itâ€™s all in the interest of gathering donations for PLEX for GOOD for the Australian
                    Bushfires, so everybody wins.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you would like to stream during the raid-a-thon please reach out to Streamfleet (either via a
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/streamfleet_eve" class="CCPlink" target="_blank">Twitter DM</a> or in
                    their Discord) and theyâ€™ll help you find a spot on the schedule and sort you out with everything you
                    need to know.

                  <p>Limited-time event, Warhead upgrades and new implants have arrived...</p>

                  <p>
                    The start of the new year has seen EVE Online's first Quadrant - Fight or Flight - begin, and it is
                    being marked by the release of the new Dragonaur Blitz event, as well as the Warhead Upgrades
                    update.
                  </p>

                  <br /><br />

                  <p>DRAGONAUR BLITZ</p>

                  <p>
                    CONCORD urges you to join the Dragonaur Blitz and attack the extremist Templis Dragonaurs outcasts
                    in Low-sec sites in specified ship types, and earn the new Nirvana Implant BPCs. This limited time
                    event ends 27 January, so act fast and get involved!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As mentioned above, only certain ship types will be allowed entry to Dragonaur Blitz sites. These
                    will include ships with bonuses to Heavy Missiles and recently rebalanced Caldari craft that are
                    most affected by the Warhead Upgrades update (details below).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Dragonaur Blitz event will also be your first opportunity as pioneering Capsuleers to earn
                    blueprints for the new High and Mid-Grade Nirvana Implants. So, it's time to climb aboard the right
                    ship, prepare for attack - as well as some surprises along the way - and hit the Templis Dragonaurs
                    extremists for the honor of the Caldari State!
                  </p>

                  <div class="image">
                    <img src="../../images/news/35_1.jpg" />
                  </div>

                  <p>WARHEAD UPGRADES</p>
                  <p>
                    Lock onto your targets with the Warhead Upgrades update, which increases the damage dealt by Heavy
                    Missiles in New Eden! The 5% increase to damage dealt by Heavy Missiles will encourage their use
                    more often in future PvP encounters.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The update also sees the introduction of the exciting new Nirvana Faction Implants, which can
                    provide bonuses to shield HP, as well as characteristics such as Perception, Memory, Intelligence,
                    Charisma, and Willpower, depending on the implant used. These implants will initially be available
                    only through the Dragonaur Blitz event, where ships that are most affected by the Warhead Upgrades
                    update will be eligible for entry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There is also a return to module tiericide with Shield Boosters. Siren fighters will also have their
                    speed reduced by way of having their Microwarp Drives replaced with Afterburners.

                  <p>
                    With the Year in EVE review videos for 2019, we also kicked off a social media contest where we
                    asked pilots across the New Eden to share their EVE Online stories from last year. The response we
                    got on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram was overwhelming and each comment only further confirmed that
                    EVE Online has the best community out there!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    All winners have been selected at random and will receive an in-game SKIN plus 500 PLEX, with two
                    lucky pilots also getting a copy of the limited edition Frigates of EVE book signed by CCP
                    developers â€“ CONGRATULATIONS!

                  <p>Here's how to apply for a Contributor or EVE Media pass at Fanfest...</p>

                  <p>
                    There are only three months to go until Fanfest 2020 and we're calling upon those players who
                    produce quality content for the EVE Online community to get in touch with us about complimentary
                    passes for the event. We want to both reward the players who go the extra mile for their hard work
                    and also make it easier for them to keep creating the content that the community loves.
                  </p>
                  <p>This year there are two categories of complimentary pass available: Contributors and EVE Media.</p>

                  <br /><br />

                  <p>CONTRIBUTORS</p>
                  <p>
                    A Contributor was previously referred to as a "Fansite" but that's something of an old fashioned
                    term when you consider all of the different kinds of media that EVE Online players now produce
                    content with. Contributors include but are not limited to:
                  </p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Streamers & video makers</li>
                    <li>3rd party tool developers (apps & websites)</li>
                    <li>Significant player gathering organizers</li>
                    <li>Bloggers</li>
                  </ul>

                  <br /><br />

                  <p>EVE MEDIA</p>
                  <p>
                    There is also a separate category for EVE Media. This category is for news sites and talk shows who
                    regularly report about the happenings of EVE Online and is specifically for people who will be
                    creating content while at Fanfest for their site - conducting interviews, filming segments,
                    recording podcasts from the event and so on.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    (If you're part of an EVE Online news organization but won't be actively working for it during your
                    time at Fanfest, please apply for a Contributor pass instead.)
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When evaluating requests for a Contributor or EVE Media pass we will be taking into account the
                    volume, quality and frequency of content that has been published over the last 12 months. The
                    Community Team at CCP has been allocated a limited number of passes and we need to make sure they go
                    to the most prolific and dedicated creators.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A successful applicant will receive an event pass providing them entry to EVE Fanfest 2020 for all
                    three days as well as access to the Party at the Top of the World on Saturday night. Tickets for any
                    additional activities such as the pub crawl or charity dinner will still have to be purchased by the
                    attendee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you have already purchased a ticket for Fanfest 2020 there is a spot on the form for you to add
                    your Eventbrite order number so that we can refund a prior purchase if we deem that you are eligible
                    for a Contributor or EVE Media pass instead.
                  </p>
                  <p>You can access the form to apply for a Contributor or EVE Media pass here.</p>

                  <p>EVE Online will be splitting the year into four sections - Quadrants -...</p>

                  <p>Pioneering Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    In the fast-moving universe of New Eden, the start of a new year offers everyone an opportunity to
                    try new things and adopt fresh approaches. To that end, this article will introduce the concept of
                    EVE Online in Quadrants for 2020, something that was first mentioned on stage at EVE Vegas at the
                    end of last year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    EVE Online will be splitting the year into four sections - Quadrants - that will allow for releases,
                    events, offers and more to exist within a given theme for that period of time. The first of these
                    Quadrants for 2020 will be "Fight or Flight" starting 16 January, which will be themed around PvP in
                    EVE, and will offer explosive rewards, challenges and changes!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A major benefit of Quadrants will be that they will allow work and efforts to be focused throughout
                    the year with a more regular cadence. Each Quadrant may contain seasonal events, balance changes and
                    game health improvements, permanent meta changes, challenges and rewards that could be themed, for
                    example, around a particular style of gameplay, or any aspect of EVE.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We're excited about what the first Quadrant will bring to New Eden! Maybe you'll even be able to
                    bring your Drake...?
                  </p>

                  <p>Update on the resource distribution in Null-Sec...</p>

                  <p>Greetings, Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    On Tuesday 17 December, Veldspar and Spodumain rocks were removed from Null-Sec asteroid belts. At
                    the same time, the quantity of ore for levels three, four and five asteroid Anomalies in Null-Sec
                    were greatly reduced (33%, 50%, and 66% respectively). These changes will vastly lower the
                    availability of some ores in Null-Sec.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This marks the beginning of the EVE resource distribution overhaul that will be taking place in the
                    coming weeks and months. The element of mystery and sense of discovery when things change in New
                    Eden without notice is something awesome to behold, therefore some of the adjustments planned will
                    be sudden like the ones that occurred on 17 December. It is also understood that certain changes
                    require precise communication in advance in order to give pilots enough time to prepare, so other
                    more gradual plans that exist for changes will be communicated in this fashion.
                  </p>

                  <p>Hello, loot-collecting Capsuleers,</p>
                  <p>
                    Earlier this year at EVE Vegas, we announced our partnership with Mixed Dimensions who will help us
                    bridge the vast universe of EVE Online with a physical world by producing 3D printed models of
                    ships. As of this week, the wait is finally over and the first seven magnificent hulls are available
                    for purchase on the official Mixed Dimensions website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The selection at launch features ships from each major faction and is available in different sizes
                    to better tailor to your individual needs. Do not fret if you donâ€™t see your favorite vessel on the
                    website because more ship styles are expected to be offered for sale in 2020, becoming available in
                    releases throughout the year!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It is very exciting to see Mixed Dimensions using their state of the art 3D printers combined with
                    proprietary software and talented artists to bring high-quality models of EVE Online ships directly
                    to your home.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Let us know on Twitter which ships you would like to see added in the future and follow Mixed
                    Dimensions for news about their work!

                    intrepid gang of CCP Devs, GMs, and ISDs through New Eden on an epic roam.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This year, an extra roam will be added. Thatâ€™s right, not one, but two roams! The first roam will be
                    undocking at 09:00 (EVE Time). The second roam will head out at 20:00 (EVE Time). To add to the
                    holiday shenanigans, these fleets will be equipped with some Reindeer Filaments, so you Null-Sec
                    Capsuleers better not be on the naughty list because CCP is coming to town! The caravan will be
                    starting off in Low Sec, and will jingle jangle its way through New Eden.
                  </p>
                  <p>To summarize, the roams are on Friday 20 December:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>09:00 (EVE Time) roam</li>
                    <li>20:00 (EVE Time) roam</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    Ships in the caravan will be carrying some holiday goodies in their cargo holds, so swing by, kill
                    some Devs and maybe you will get some PLEX and loot! This is also your best chance to throw some
                    snowballs at a Developer, or maybe even scoop a frozen Dev corpse or two, apparently they trade
                    well!
                  </p>
                  <p>You can tune in for all the fun on the official CCP Twitch channel.</p>

                  <p>Light your lucky star with the brand new Yoiul Star SKINs...</p>

                  <p>
                    The festive Yoiul Star SKINs are available until 7 January 2020 and come with a unique effect!
                    Starting 13 days before Christmas, a green charge bar will appear on the SKIN and will gradually
                    fill every day until a green star appears at the front of the ship.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    This seasonal effect wonâ€™t be there permanently and will disappear from the SKIN after 13 January,
                    but next year on the 12th December the charge starts up again. Get into the festive spirit with one
                    of these fun new SKINs!
                  </p>

                  <p>HyperCores in the New Eden Store</p>
                  <p>
                    The HyperNet Relay has landed and is proving incredibly popular with the capsuleers of New Eden.
                    Anyone can purchase HyperNodes with ISK but to create a HyperNet offer you'll need some HyperCores
                    which you can get from the in-game market or from the New Eden Store where 10 PLEX will get you 100
                    HyperCores.
                  </p>
                  <p>See what all the hype is about (see what I did there?) and check out the HyperNet Relay today!</p>
