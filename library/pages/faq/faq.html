                <h1>WHAT IS EVE ONLINE?</h1>
              </div>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <h1>1. WHO DO I PLAY AS?</h1>
                <p>
                  You are what is known as a “capsuleer”, a talented pilot
                  hardwired into the interface of a powerful warship. Such a
                  pilot can fulfill the roles of an entire command crew all by
                  himself, managing all aspects of his spaceship from within the
                  armored cocoon of his capsule. They can challenge a number of
                  conventionally piloted ships and emerge victorious. When
                  allied together, they can forge empires out of the empty void
                  of space itself. In EVE you are free to choose your own
                  destiny. You start out as a character from one of the four
                  major factions that rule the universe. Each faction starts off
                  with a very similar skill set and you can develop your
                  character in any direction you want. You are not restricted by
                  predefined character classes or professions. You can trade to
                  make a living, conduct mining operations, market your fighting
                  skills as a mercenary, roam the spacelanes as a pirate,
                  conduct espionage and infiltration, focus on research and
                  manufacturing, or perform increasingly profitable missions for
                  NPC (non-player controlled) agents. What you choose to do day
                  by day is up to you. You can play alone, form a corporation
                  (equivalent to a clan or guild) with a group of friends or
                  seek entrance to any of the large player-run corporations and
                  alliances which are already established. The EVE Universe and
                  its more than 7,600 unique solar systems are yours to explore
                  and conquer.
                </p>
                <h1>2. WHERE DOES EVE ONLINE TAKE PLACE?</h1>
                <p>
                  EVE Online takes place in the far future in an area of space
                  far removed from Earth. EVE Online takes its name from the
                  massive EVE Gate, which enabled humanity to enter the cluster
                  of stars which became known as New Eden. Following the
                  collapse of the EVE Gate and the loss of all contact with
                  Earth, the survivors have developed new thriving civilizations
                  and started seeking their destiny among the stars.
                </p>
                <h1>3. WHAT IS MEANT BY “MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER GAME”?</h1>
                <p>
                  Massively Multiplayer refers to any game which involves
                  hundreds or thousands of users taking part in the same game
                  world at any given time. EVE Online has played host to massive
                  battles between thousands of players at a time affecting the
                  fates of dozens of star systems.
                </p>
                <h1>4. WHAT IS MEANT BY “CONTINUOUS AND PERSISTENT WORLD”?</h1>
                <p>
                  A persistent game world will keep evolving even when a player
                  has gone offline. The game world, and anything the player may
                  have left in it, such as undocked ships, will continue to
                  exist and will be visible to (and possibly destroyed by) other
                  players. It is a living, breathing virtual world which never
                  sleeps and never stops changing through the actions of its
                  players.

                  PLEX stands for 30 day Pilot License Extension and is another
                  way to pay for your EVE Online subscription. They can also be
                  bought and sold on the in-game market which is one way to add
                  more ISK to your wallet if you need some in a hurry and don’t
                  have the time to earn it by gameplay.

                  >
                  from the EVE Online website (and from authorized resellers),
                  sell it in-game and then spend the ISK that you make. The
                  player who buys the PLEX can then use it to add 30 days to
                  their subscription. This system works well for all types of
                  players; some have a lot of ISK in-game and can therefore use
                  that virtual currency that they’ve earned to pay for their
                  game time. Some have less time to play the game, but would
                  still like to have the ISK to buy bigger, better ships and
                  modules, so they can buy PLEX and use the ISK from the sale to
                  get themselves the items that they want.

                  EVE Online costs $14.95, €14.95 or £9.99 per month. But if you
                  were to subscribe for a longer period, then the cost will
                  drop; a 1 year subscription will cost the equivalent of
                  $10.95, €10.95 or £7.50 per month for example. More on the
                  subscription costs (and costs in other currencies) can be
                  found
